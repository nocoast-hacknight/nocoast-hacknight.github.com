### No really, where is it (Extended directions)

The easiest way to get to Light Hall is to park your car on 24th near Highland outside the VA hospital. 
Walk through the VA parking. Pass by the VA emergency room entrance (leaving it to your right). 
You will see a short brown VA building ahead of you, go around it. Light Hall has a revolving door. 
If you are coming/biking from 21st Ave side, go up the ramp from 22nd ave to the Eskind Biomedical Library building 
(all glass with a red statue in front of it). To your left (south) there is a courtyard with an Au-Bon-Pain
(previously McDonald). Medical Research Building 4 / Langford Auditorium (same bldg) is right next to the Medical Library, Light Hall is next to that across from Au-Bon-Pain.
