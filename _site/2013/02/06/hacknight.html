Firas, Matt, and I had a good hang and hack at Craft Brewed. Learned
more about github pages, talked about spine for pyramid, did some
speccing for keg app.

Craft Brewed is an awesome location. It's quiet and allows for folks
to bring in food.  I think we should do a potluck there every first
wednesday of the month, and do a second hacknight the third wednesday
at the taproom.
